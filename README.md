The Challenge


Hangman is a classic game of incomplete information and probabilistic reasoning. While humans often rely on intuition and simple letter frequency (like guessing 'E,' 'T,' 'A,' or 'O'), a truly intelligent agent can do better. It can learn the contextual patterns of a language to make strategic, informed decisions.Your challenge is to build such an agent.Your mission is to design and build an intelligent Hangman assistant that effectively guesses letters to solve puzzles with maximum efficiency. The goal is not just to win, but to win with the fewest possible mistakes, leveraging machine learning to peer into the hidden word.# ML_Hackathon_team_14
